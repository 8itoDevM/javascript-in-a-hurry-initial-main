Hi!

This project it is not mine.
Only .js files are mine, because i'm currently doing a Javascript course

If you check my profile, you are going to see that i am developing a website.
i am the back-end dev and my freind "devjoaoarthur" is the front-end dev

if you are interested on that project, we need someone that knows how
servers/hosts works, because we are going to need, to create databases
and a lot of similar things to our idea work.

We are also trying to find customers that are interested in having a
website.
